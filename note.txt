//testing with "CDN" first by not downloading "React"
CDN.html //but for production, might need to set up React Environment
CDN_queryselector.html //use "query selector" instead of "get ElementbyId" and no need to create root also, 
instead, render with "Component and "queryselector's variable".
//Create "React" Environment
//to create, need to download "node.js" so that can use npx
//note: by integrating node.js, also accepted to install chocolatory
//Alert: there was a problem which is the system can't be able to find the file path when use "npx create-react-app <app name>"
//Solution : create folder name "npm" in this directory "C:\Users\Sophie\AppData\Roaming\"
npx create-react-app first
//first>src>app.js
//<h1>Hello World</h1>
