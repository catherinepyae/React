git clone https://github.com/catherinepyae/React.git
cd React
//testing with "CDN" first by not downloading "React"
CDN.html //but for production, might need to set up React Environment
CDN_queryselector.html //use "query selector" instead of "get ElementbyId" and no need to create root also, 
instead, render with "Component and "queryselector's variable".
//Create "React" Environment
//in production, need Node.js and also npm
//to create, need to download "node.js" so that can use npx
//note: by integrating node.js, also accepted to install chocolatory
//Alert: there was a problem which is the system can't be able to find the file path when use "npx create-react-app <app name>"
//Solution : create folder name "npm" in this directory "C:\Users\Sophie\AppData\Roaming\"
npx create-react-app first
//first>src>app.js
//<h1>Hello World</h1>

Component
----------------
class Component -> must include extends React.Component. This create an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions
This also require "render()" method. 
function Component -> same effect with class component, but it can be written using much less code, easier to understand
see "Car.js"

Props
-----
Component can be passed as props(properties)
//Cars.js
function Cars(props){
    return <h1>We are cars {props.color}</h1>
}
export default Cars;
//index.js
<Cars color="red" />

At different laptop
------------------
got to solve error with "npm install"
